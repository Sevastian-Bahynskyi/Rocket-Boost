# Rocket Boost

If you're interested in trying my game, please use the link below.
Note that the platform makes the game unoptimized (not only mine). That's why the gameplay doesn't feel that smooth.

This is my first game I made. Though I did follow a tutorial, I tried to chalenge myself and make everything on my own. 
I added some great mechanics like buttons, asteroid rain and portals. Interested? See if you can complete all 9 levels I made!
